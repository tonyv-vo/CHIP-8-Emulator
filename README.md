# CHIP-8-Emulator
This is a simple CHIP-8 emulation program I made in Java using JavaFX. I also used JUnit to create unit tests for each of the 33 opcodes.

## Using the Emulator
To load a ROM into the emulator, go to "File > Load ROM" in the menu bar and then select the ROM file you wish to load.
To restart the emulator program, got to "File > Restart".

## Planned features
I am planning to add the following features in the future to make this project more complete:
* Sound via the sound timer
* A GUI for debugging
* A further extension from CHIP-8 to Super-Chip and CHIP-48
